  <h1>Gregorian vs. Hijri Age: Why Your Real Age Might Surprise You</h1>
  <p>Understanding the differences between solar and lunar timekeeping in حساب العمر</p>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <p>
      The way we measure time defines how we perceive our lives, milestones, and history. Most of the world follows the <strong>Gregorian calendar</strong>, but in Islamic culture, the <strong>Hijri (lunar) calendar</strong> holds deep spiritual and cultural importance.  
      When it comes to calculating your age — known in Arabic as <a href="https://hisabulomr.com/" target="_blank">حساب العمر</a> — the calendar you use can make a surprising difference.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Why Two Calendars Matter</h2>
    <p>
      Both the Gregorian and Hijri calendars are used to measure time, but they’re based on different celestial cycles:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Calendar Type</th>
          <th>Basis</th>
          <th>Average Year Length</th>
          <th>Common Use</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Gregorian</td>
          <td>Solar (Earth’s orbit around the Sun)</td>
          <td>365.24 days</td>
          <td>Global / Civil affairs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hijri</td>
          <td>Lunar (Moon’s orbit around the Earth)</td>
          <td>354.36 days</td>
          <td>Religious observances / Islamic events</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Because a lunar year is about 11 days shorter than a solar year, a person’s <strong>Hijri age</strong> will always be slightly higher than their Gregorian age. Over decades, that difference adds up significantly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. The Hidden Difference: Why You’re “Older” in the Hijri System</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      Every 33 Gregorian years equals roughly 34 Hijri years — meaning your Hijri birthday always arrives sooner!
    </div>
    <p>
      For example, if someone was born on January 1, 1990, they’d be 35 years old in 2025 according to the Gregorian calendar. But their age in the Hijri system would be around 36. This is because the lunar calendar “runs faster,” completing a year in fewer days.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gregorian year:</strong> 365 days</li>
      <li><strong>Hijri year:</strong> 354 days</li>
      <li><strong>Annual difference:</strong> 11 days</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Historical and Cultural Background</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>Hijri calendar</em> began with the Prophet Muhammad’s migration (<em>Hijrah</em>) from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE, which marked a turning point in Islamic history. Unlike the Gregorian system, which is based on solar patterns, the Hijri system aligns with the moon’s cycles, reinforcing the connection between spiritual observance and natural time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This calendar is vital for determining religious events such as Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Hajj. It also serves as the foundation for Islamic age calculation, emphasizing a deeper rhythm of timekeeping.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. حساب العمر in Both Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding how <strong>حساب العمر</strong> differs between calendars is essential. While the Gregorian system is often used in education, employment, and international documentation, the Hijri age has cultural and religious relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To explore this concept further, see <a href="https://clarkk21.github.io/hijri-age-culture-insights/" target="_blank">Hijri Age Culture Insights</a>, which provides a detailed overview of how age is interpreted in Islamic societies.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Gregorian age → Used for legal, academic, and global purposes.</li>
      <li>Hijri age → Used for religious obligations and spiritual milestones.</li>
      <li>Both coexist → Many Muslims track both for different contexts.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. How to Convert Between Hijri and Gregorian Ages</h2>
    <p>
      Converting your age between the two calendars is a matter of understanding the time ratio between solar and lunar years. To calculate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiply your Gregorian age by <strong>1.0307</strong> to estimate your Hijri age.</li>
      <li>Or, multiply your Hijri age by <strong>0.9707</strong> to find your Gregorian equivalent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Conversion</h3>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Gregorian Age (Years)</th>
          <th>Hijri Age (Years)</th>
          <th>Approx. Difference (Days)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>10.3</td>
          <td>~110</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>25</td>
          <td>25.8</td>
          <td>~275</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>40</td>
          <td>41.2</td>
          <td>~440</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Why the Lunar Cycle Matters Spiritually</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond mathematics, the lunar rhythm has symbolic meaning. Each month begins with the sighting of a new crescent moon, reflecting the renewal of faith and awareness of life’s passage. The Hijri calendar invites believers to observe time as part of divine order — not just as a human construct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many Islamic scholars emphasize that knowing your Hijri age strengthens your connection with religious events and helps align your life milestones with the Islamic year.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Practical Uses in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
      Knowing both your Hijri and Gregorian ages can be valuable in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Religious milestones:</strong> Understanding when you become eligible for fasting or Hajj.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal documentation:</strong> Some countries record birthdates in both systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal reflection:</strong> Observing birthdays by both calendars adds cultural depth.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. A Reflection on Time and Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you calculate your life through the Gregorian or Hijri lens, both systems tell a story of how humanity relates to the cosmos. Your “real age” is not just a number — it’s a reflection of your faith, culture, and the rhythm of nature.
    </p>

      Understanding both calendars is not about comparison, but about appreciating how time connects us across civilizations and belief systems.
